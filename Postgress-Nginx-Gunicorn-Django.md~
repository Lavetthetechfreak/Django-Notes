Installing vthe viretual env is quite simple. Just run the following command:  
        sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv  
        
 Now create the virtual env with a name of your choice, I suggest one related to the current project.  
        
        sudo virtualenv /<root folder>/<virtualenv name>  
        
A directory will be created with the environment name.
